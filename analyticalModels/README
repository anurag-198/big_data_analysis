6VideoDifficultyModel-final-working-multiple-videos.py
  ---- The final prototype of the data model. It would work on the top 10 videos watched in the CS101.1x course,
       and for the top 50 users who have watched it.
       
       DataBase: IITBxDataAnalytics
       Tables:   CourseVideos, UserSessionOldLog
       
       Video id's are hard coded, some test user names are there.
       Output appears on console.
  
updateYoutubeVideoLength.py
  ---- The Python code which draws the youtube id's from the CourseVideos tables, and uses the Google YouTube API
       to get the durations of each of the videos, and store it in the CourseVideos table.
  
videoDifficultySpark.py
  ---- The actual implementation of the data model in Spark. For a detailed explanation of this and the previous
       prototype, please go through the Final report documentation. It should bring you up to what has been done
       so far, as the document covers everything from scratch.
